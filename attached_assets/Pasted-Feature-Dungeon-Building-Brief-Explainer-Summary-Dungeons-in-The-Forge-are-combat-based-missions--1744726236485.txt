Feature: Dungeon Building
Brief Explainer Summary: Dungeons in The Forge are combat-based missions where players send their characters to engage in auto-battles across multiple stages. The mission’s outcome is determined by the characters' stats, Aura multipliers, skill usage priority, passive effects, and battle mechanics. Each dungeon features a reward curve based on the number of stages completed, with specific loot drops tied to difficulty and elemental themes.

Comprehensive Description:
Dungeon Structure
Each dungeon consists of 8 sequential stages.


A mini-boss appears on Stage 4, and a final boss appears on Stage 8.


New enemies spawn at the start of each stage.


Enemy difficulty increases progressively with each stage.


All characters (both allies and enemies) begin the dungeon at full HP.


Allies retain HP between stages.


Status effects do NOT carry over between stages.


When a character is defeated, they remain defeated unless revived via skill or item.


Character Team Setup
Players can assign up to 4 characters to a dungeon mission.


Each character is equipped with a unique Aura that determines:


Stat multipliers


Available Basic, Advanced, and Ultimate skills


Attack Meter & Turn System
Each unit has an Attack Meter which fills based on total Speed (including buffs, debuffs, status effects, and Aura bonuses).


The meter uses a smooth ticker system (minimum 50+ ticks).


When the meter reaches 100%, the unit takes an action, and the meter resets to 0%.


Characters with 120 Speed charge their meter 3x faster than those with 40 Speed.


Tiebreakers (two or more units ready on the same tick) are resolved by Speed, then random roll if tied.


Skill Priority System
Skills are selected in the following priority:


Ultimate Skill (if available)


Advanced Skill (if available)


Basic Attack (default)


Advanced and Ultimate skills have individual cooldowns.


Cooldowns reset to max at the start of each stage.


Cooldowns are also reduced by 1 when progressing to the next stage.


Cooldown logic includes usage tracking and manual overrides per skill if needed.


Skill Effects and Targeting
Most skills may include:


Damage


Healing


Buffs


Debuffs


Status Effects


Smart Targeting AI determines optimal skill use, unless a skill has predefined logic.


Examples: target with lowest HP, highest Attack, random enemy, etc.


Healing Logic
Healing logic must define:


Whether the healing amount is based on:


Target's max HP


Caster's max HP


Caster's Attack stat


How the target is selected:


Ally with lowest HP %


Ally with lowest absolute HP


Status Effects
Status effects are triggered by skill logic and RNG.


Logs must include: skill used, chance to apply, actual roll, result.


Status effects tick when the target's Attack Meter reaches 100%.


Effects such as Poison/Burn trigger just before the unit acts.


Effects like Minor Slow / Minor Weakness decrement after the unit's action.


Stacking rules:


Poison/Burn can stack independently (e.g., 4 stacks of Poison with 3 turns each).


Non-stackable effects (e.g., Minor Weakness) can only be reapplied if the new effect has equal or longer duration.


Interrupt Effects
Effects like Stun or Silence prevent action when a meter reaches 100%.


The meter still resets.


Effect duration decrements by 1.


Turn Meter Modification
Some skills may increase or reduce a unit's turn meter.


Examples: "Reduce target meter by 25%" or "Gain 50% meter instantly"


Values must be clamped to a 0% - 100% range.


Stage Transition Rules
After a stage is completed:


New enemies spawn.


All character meters reset to 0%.


Skill cooldowns are reduced by 1 (but not below 0).


All defeated characters remain defeated.


Rewards System
Players earn rewards based on stages completed:


A loot roll system determines reward tiers based on progress.


Example Roll Table:


0 Stages = Roll 0 to 0


1 Stage = Roll 1 to 20


2 Stages = Roll 10 to 30


...


8 Stages = Roll 50 to 100


Reward Tiers:


Tier 1: Roll ≥1


Tier 2: Roll ≥15


Tier 3: Roll ≥25


...


Tier 10: Roll ≥95


Loot Crates will reflect tier, difficulty, and elemental dungeon theme.


Elemental Dungeon Themes
Dungeon themes include: Fire, Water, Wind, Earth.


Each theme affects:


Loot table (e.g., Fire Essences)


Possibly aura drop rates or theme-specific status effects


Rest Periods
Characters rest after completing a dungeon.


Defeated characters require longer rest periods.


Forge Tokens or consumables can reduce rest time.


Dungeon Refresh & Limits
Dungeons refresh every 15 minutes.


Only one active mission per difficulty allowed at a time.


Higher Dungeon Building Level increases:


Concurrent dungeon missions


Available difficulty tiers


Battle Summary and Logs
Players receive:


Summary: Total damage, healing, damage received per character


Reward Report: Earned + missed rewards


Battle Log:


Timestamped entries per action


Skill used, damage dealt/healed, status effect attempts, buffs, etc.
