Here’s a clean and detailed prompt you can use to instruct AI (or a developer) to implement the **Live Battle Replay** system for your game:

**Prompt: Implement Live Battle Replay for Dungeon Runs**

Add a **Live Battle Replay** feature to the Dungeon system that allows players to review completed runs through a real-time visual simulation. This replay should accurately reflect the combat interactions between all party members and enemies.

### **Core Requirements**

#### **1. Combat Flow**
- Each unit (ally or enemy) has an **attack meter** that fills based on their **Speed stat**.
  - A character with **120 Speed** attacks 3x as frequently as a character with **40 Speed**.
- When the attack meter is full, the unit performs an action:
  - **Default**: Basic skill from their equipped Aura
  - **Advanced Skill**: Used every _N_ attacks, where _N = cooldown value_ (e.g., 4 = every 4th attack)
  - **Ultimate Skill**: Same cooldown logic as above

#### **2. Stat Behavior**
- **Attack** = determines outgoing damage
- **Vitality** × 8 = total HP
- **Speed** = determines how fast the attack meter fills
- Skill effects (damage, buffs, debuffs, healing, etc.) should be pulled from the Aura data

#### **3. Replay Controls**
- Player must be able to:
  - **Pause** the replay
  - **Speed up** playback (2x, 4x options)
  - **Complete** instantly to skip to the result screen

#### **4. Result Summary**
After the Dungeon replay ends, show a detailed summary:
- **Each character:**
  - Total damage dealt
  - Total damage received
  - Total healing done and received
- **Overall dungeon outcome:**
  - Stages completed
  - Rewards earned

#### **5. Defeat Penalty**
- Any character defeated during the battle will enter a **5-minute rest cooldown** and cannot be used in other activities until the timer ends.

### **Additional Recommendations**

For the first version or future versions, consider the following enhancements:

- **Action Log Panel**: Text log of actions taken per second (e.g., “Zara used Flame Bolt – 218 dmg”)
- **Health Bars & Status Effects**: Display real-time HP bars and active buffs/debuffs above each unit
- **Skip to Key Moments**: Add buttons to skip to a character's defeat or boss phase
- **Camera Focus**: Auto-focus the camera on units when they act, or let players manually follow a specific unit
- **Replay Save/Share**: Allow storing a replay or sharing it via a link or code
- **Combat Metrics Export**: Option to export damage/healing data for performance tracking
- **Auto Highlights**: End-of-battle MVP and most-damaged display
- **Optional Fog of War**: Add light visual effects like battlefield fog or lighting for mood
