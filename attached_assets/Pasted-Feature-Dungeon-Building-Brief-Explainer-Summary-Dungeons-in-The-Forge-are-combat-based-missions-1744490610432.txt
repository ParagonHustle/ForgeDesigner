Feature: Dungeon Building
Brief Explainer Summary:
Dungeons in The Forge are combat-based missions where players send their characters to engage in auto-battles across multiple stages. The mission’s outcome is determined by the characters' stats, Aura multipliers, and battle mechanics. Each dungeon features a reward curve based on the number of stages completed, with specific loot drops tied to difficulty and elemental themes.

Comprehensive Description:
The Dungeon Building allows players to form a team of up to 4 characters to participate in auto-battle dungeons. Each dungeon is composed of 8 stages, with a mini-boss at stage 4 and a final boss at stage 8. The difficulty increases progressively as players advance through the dungeon stages.
Key Dungeon Features:
Auto-battle Mechanics:


Attack Frequency is determined by Speed.


Attack Damage is calculated using:
 Attack Damage = Attack Stat * Aura Multiplier * Skill Damage


Hitpoints (HP) are calculated using:
 Hitpoints = Vitality * 8 (adjustable multiplier for future fine-tuning)


Server-Side Tuning: Ability to adjust stat multipliers for each character’s NFT, ensuring balance flexibility (e.g., Kleos may have a 150% Attack multiplier, while Brawler Frank has a 180% multiplier).


Dungeon Mechanics:


Characters continue in the dungeon until all stages are completed or the team is defeated.


Timers for each stage are required in case of extended battles (e.g., due to healing mechanics).


Healing Mechanics: Characters with healing skills may prolong fights, resulting in a timer that counts down until one team defeats the other.


Reward System:
Dungeon rewards are determined by the number of stages completed:


Tier-based loot rolls depend on the total stages completed:


0 Stages = Roll 0 to 0


1 Stage = Roll 1 to 20


2 Stages = Roll 10 to 30


3 Stages = Roll 15 to 40


4 Stages = Roll 25 to 60


5 Stages = Roll 30 to 70


6 Stages = Roll 35 to 80


7 Stages = Roll 40 to 90


8 Stages = Roll 50 to 100


Rewards are tiered based on the final roll:


Tier 1: Roll a 1+


Tier 2: Roll a 15+


Tier 3: Roll a 25+


Tier 4: Roll a 35+


Tier 5: Roll a 45+


Tier 6: Roll a 55+


Tier 7: Roll a 65+


Tier 8: Roll a 75+


Tier 9: Roll a 85+


Tier 10: Roll a 95+


Dungeon Lootcrate Rewards:


Lootcrate rewards will be added based on tier, difficulty, and elemental themes.


Elemental Dungeon Themes:


Dungeons will have elemental themes: Fire, Water, Wind, Earth.


Each theme offers different crafting materials and potentially Auras linked to those themes.


Team Rest Period:


Characters require a rest period after completing a dungeon.


If characters are defeated, they require longer rest times.


Forge Tokens or special items can speed up the rest period.


Dungeon Missions:
Dungeons refresh every 15 minutes.


Players can participate in a maximum of one dungeon mission of each difficulty at any given time (e.g., two Hard difficulty dungeons cannot run concurrently).


Dungeon Building Level:


Higher levels of the Dungeon Building unlock additional dungeon missions.


The Dungeon Building Level determines the maximum number of active missions and the available difficulty tiers.


Battle Summary & Log:
Upon completing a dungeon, players receive:


Summary: Total damage dealt, damage received, healing done, and contributions of each team member.


Possible Rewards: A breakdown of the rewards the player could have earned had they completed all stages or gotten luckier with the rolls.


Battle Log: A detailed text-based log showing each attack, healing, buffs, debuffs, status effects, etc., for full transparency.
