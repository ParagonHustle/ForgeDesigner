Balanced Paths (Each path = 30 total possible upgrades):
Path A: Speed & Efficiency

Crafting Speed: (10 Levels, 3% each = 30%)

Double Forge Chance: (10 Levels, 1.5% each = 15%)

Crafting Slots: Slot #2 at Level 5, Slot #3 at Level 10

Advanced Crafting Speed: (10 Levels, +2% each = 20%)

Special Cross-Path Upgrades (Each Combination = 9 Levels max):
Players unlock these after investing at least 20 points total (10 in each chosen path).

Each cross-path has 3 tiers, 3 levels each, totaling 9 points maximum per combination.

Players invest in two paths (20 points each = 40), then 9 points in the cross-path upgrades, totaling exactly 49 points.
